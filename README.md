This repository contains implementation of semi-supervised transfer learning workflow for nanowire morphology classification and segmentation from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.

Paper: [Semi-supervised machine learning workflow for analysis of nanowire morphologies from transmission electron microscopy images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13875) is available in arXiv
## Dataset
The peptide / protein nanowires used in this study were synthesized and imaged by Brian Montz in Prof. Todd Emrick's research group at the Department of Polymer Science and Engineering Department, University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

The TEM image dataset of the nanowire morphologies along with manual segmentation masks and image encoders trained via self-supervised training are hosted on Zenodo, [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6377140](https://zenodo.org/record/6377140)
